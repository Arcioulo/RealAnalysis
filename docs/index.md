## Exercise 7.6.14

### _Part A_

Given 

$$g(x) = \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
            x^2 \sin(\frac{1}{x}) & \quad x > 0 \\
            0 & \quad x \leq 0
        \end{array}
    \right.
$$

$$g'(0) = \lim_{x \to 0}{\frac{g(x) - 0}{x}} = \lim_{x \to 0}{x\sin(\frac{1}{x})} = 0$$    

### _Part B_

Using standard rules for differentation $g'(x)$ for $x \neq 0$ can be computed as follows:

$$g'(x) = 2x\sin(\frac{1}{x}) - \cos(\frac{1}{x})$$
