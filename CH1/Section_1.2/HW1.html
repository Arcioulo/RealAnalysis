<h3 id="original-solution">Original Solution</h3>
<h4 id="part-a">Part A</h4>
<h4 id="prove-that-sqrt3-is-irrational"><em>Prove that <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{3}\)</span> is irrational</em></h4>
<p>Assume <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{3}\)</span> is rational. If <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{3}\)</span> is rational, then it can be written as a ratio of two relatively prime natural numbers, a and b, such that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{a}{b} = \sqrt{3}\]</span></p>
<p>Proof:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{a}{b} = \sqrt{3}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{a^2}{b^2} = {3}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{a^2} = {3}{b^2}\]</span></p>
<p>This implies that <span class="math inline">\({a^2}\)</span> and thus a, are divisible by 3. We can rewrite a as a multiple of 3:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[a = 3*c\]</span></p>
<p>where c is some natural number. Subtituting in for a, we see:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{(3*c)}^2  = 3b^2\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[9c^2 = 3b^2\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[3c^2 = b^2\]</span></p>
<p>This is a contradiction as both a and b were assumed to be relatively prime. Thus <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{3}\)</span> is irrational.</p>
<h4 id="does-a-similar-argument-work-to-show-sqrt6-is-irrational"><em>Does a similar argument work to show <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{6}\)</span> is irrational?</em></h4>
<p>Assume <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{6}\)</span> is rational. If <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{6}\)</span> is rational, then it can be written as a ratio of two relatively prime natural numbers, a and b, such that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{a}{b} = \sqrt{6}\]</span></p>
<p>Proof:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{a}{b} = \sqrt{6}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{a^2}{b^2} = {6}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{a^2} = {6}{b^2}\]</span></p>
<p>This implies that <span class="math inline">\({a^2}\)</span> and thus a, are divisible by 6, as well as its factors 2 and 3. We can rewrite a as a multiple of 2:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[a = 2*c\]</span></p>
<p>where c is some natural number. Subtituting in for a, we see:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{(2*c)}^2  = 6b^2\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[4c^2 = 6b^2\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[2c^2 = 3^2\]</span></p>
<p>This is a contradiction as both a and b were assumed to be relatively prime. Thus <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{6}\)</span> is irrational.</p>
<h4 id="part-b">Part B</h4>
<h4 id="where-does-the-proof-of-theorem-1.1.1-break-down-if-we-try-to-use-it-to-prove-sqrt4-is-irrational"><em>Where does the proof of Theorem 1.1.1 break down if we try to use it to prove <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{4}\)</span> is irrational?</em></h4>
<p>Assume <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{4}\)</span> is rational. If <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{4}\)</span> is rational, then it can be written as a ratio of two relatively prime natural numbers, a and b, such that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{a}{b} = \sqrt{4}\]</span></p>
<p>Proof:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{a}{b} = \sqrt{4}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{a^2}{b^2} = {4}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{a^2} = {4}{b^2}\]</span></p>
<p>This implies that <span class="math inline">\({a^2}\)</span> and thus a, are divisible by 2. We can rewrite a as a multiple of 2:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[a = 2*c\]</span></p>
<p>where c is some natural number. Subtituting in for a, we see:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{(2*c)}^2  = 4b^2\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[4c^2 = 4b^2\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[c^2 = b^2\]</span></p>
<p>From theorem 1.1.1 we should able to rewrite <span class="math inline">\(b^2\)</span> at this point in a way that breaks the assumption that b is relatively prime. However, this is not the case and thus we can assume that <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{4}\)</span> is rational.</p>
<h3 id="self-evaluation">Self-Evaluation</h3>
<h4 id="part-b-1">Part b</h4>
<p>My proof worked to show that both numbers were not relatively prime. Thus I replaced a = 2 in my answer to show that <span class="math inline">\(b^2\)</span> is in fact relatively prime. I could have stopped earlier in my answer to explain the shortcomings of the proof, but I decided to see the substitution through to prove the point.</p>

<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(x \in A \bigcap B\)</span> this then implies</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[g(x) \in g(A) \bigcap g(B)\]</span></p>
<p>The next step in the justification process I struggled with some, as I could not find a good way to justify why <span class="math inline">\(g(A \bigcap B) \subseteq g(A) \bigcap g(B)\)</span> other than the fact it is obvious given the above relationship.</p>
<h4 id="part-d">Part D</h4>

<p>My conjecture is that <span class="math inline">\(g(A \bigcup B) = g(A) \bigcup g(B)\)</span></p>
<p>My intuition about this comes from a background in boolean logic. My first inclination was to try and prove this with a truth table, but I could not make it generic enough for this process.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(x \in A \bigcup B\)</span> this then implies</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[g(x) \in g(A \bigcup B) = g(A) \bigcup g(B)\]</span></p>
<p>Again I somewhat struggled with the last step of this process as I could not find a clear way to communicate the equality of this relationship other than the fact that I feel it is intuitively obvious.</p>
<h3 id="self-evaluation-1">Self-Evaluation</h3>
<h4 id="part-a-2">Part A</h4>
<p>My answers for finding <span class="math inline">\(f(A) \textrm { and } f(B)\)</span> lack verification that the solution range maps back to the original domain. I did not think this was needed, due to the nature of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> given in the problem.</p>
<h4 id="part-b-3">Part B</h4>
<p>My answer differs, but is logically consistent with the solution presented.</p>
<h4 id="part-c-1">Part C</h4>
<p>Reviewing the solution, I see that the component I was missing in my answer was working backwards from the assumption that <span class="math inline">\(y \in g(A \bigcap B)\)</span> as the start of my proof. I hit a wall when trying to connect the relationship between <span class="math inline">\(g(A \bigcap B)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g(A) \bigcap (B)\)</span> but I now see how that is accomplished.</p>
<h4 id="part-d-1">Part D</h4>
<p>The beginning part of my answer lacks some of the formality shown in setting up the conjecture. I assumed that the nature of the sets, A and B, were obvious given the context of the problem.</p>
<p>As for the proof itself, I made a similar mistake as I did in part C. Had I started my proof with the assumption shown, I feel I would have been able to work through the proof more effectively. My answer also originally stated <span class="math inline">\(g(x) \in g(A \bigcup B) = g(A \bigcup B)\)</span> but this has been updated in this submssion to be: <span class="math inline">\(g(x) \in g(A \bigcup B) = g(A) \bigcup g(B)\)</span>.</p>

<h4 id="f-n---n-textrm-that-is-1-1-but-not-onto"><em><span class="math inline">\(f : N -&gt; N \textrm{ that is 1-1 but not onto}\)</span></em></h4>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = 2(x)+1\)</span></p>
<p>then</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(1) = 3\]</span> <span class="math display">\[f(2) = 5\]</span> <span class="math display">\[...\]</span></p>
<p>so the mapping is 1-1, in that it maps every element uniquely, but not all of B is represented, i.e. there are no even numbers in the mapping.</p>
<h4 id="part-b-4">Part B</h4>
<h4 id="f-n---n-textrm-that-is-onto-but-not-1-1"><em><span class="math inline">\(f : N -&gt; N \textrm{ that is onto but not 1-1}\)</span></em></h4>
<p>Let</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f(x) = \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
            x &amp; \quad x &lt; 5 \\
            x-5 &amp; \quad x \geq 5
        \end{array}
    \right.
\]</span></p>
<p>The mapping is onto, in that all of B is represented. However it is not 1-1. For example <span class="math inline">\(f(6) = f(1)\)</span>.</p>
<h4 id="part-c-2">Part C</h4>
<h4 id="f-n---z-textrm-that-is-1-1-and-onto"><em><span class="math inline">\(f : N -&gt; Z \textrm{ that is 1-1 and onto}\)</span></em></h4>
<p>This is not possible. Because <span class="math inline">\(N \subseteq Z\)</span>, a function that is both 1-1 and onto cannot be achieved.</p>
<h3 id="self-evaluation-2">Self-Evaluation</h3>
<h4 id="part-a-4">Part A</h4>
<p>My answer differs, but I believe it is still correct for the same reasoning presented in the solutions.</p>
<h4 id="part-b-5">Part B</h4>
<p>The same as above, my answers differs but I believe it is still a valid solution.</p>
<h4 id="part-c-3">Part C</h4>
<p>My logic here was flawed about the relationship between <span class="math inline">\(N \textrm{ and } Z\)</span>. I was struggling to come up with a well behaved function that met the requirements of the problem statement, so I took a guess that it was not possible.</p>

<h4 id="part-a-5">Part A</h4>
<h4 id="for-all-real-numbers-satisfying-ab-there-exists-an-n-in-n-such-that-a-frac1n-b"><em>For all real numbers satisfying <span class="math inline">\(a&lt;b\)</span>, there exists an <span class="math inline">\(n \in N\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(a + \frac{1}{n} &lt; b\)</span></em></h4>
<p>There exists real numbers <span class="math inline">\(a&lt;b\)</span> such that for all <span class="math inline">\(n \in N a + \frac{1}{n} \geq b\)</span></p>
<p>The negated statement falls apart when trying to prove the statement holds <em>for all</em> <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. For example if we let <span class="math inline">\(a = 1, b = 2, \textrm{ and } n = 10\)</span>, the negated statement is false (for all <span class="math inline">\(n&gt;1\)</span>). Conversely, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> can always be chosen in such a way that the original statement is true, regardless of the values for <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>.</p>
<h4 id="part-b-6">Part B</h4>
<h4 id="there-exists-a-real-number-x0-such-that-x1n-for-all-n-in-n"><em>There exists a real number <span class="math inline">\(x&gt;0\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x&lt;1/n\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(n \in N\)</span></em></h4>
<p>For all real numbers, <span class="math inline">\(x&gt;0\)</span>, there exists an n (<span class="math inline">\(n \in N\)</span>) such that <span class="math inline">\(x \geq \frac{1}{n}\)</span></p>
<p>I would hypothesize that the orignal statement is correct. The negated statement does not hold across <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> for all possible <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. For example if <span class="math inline">\(x = 0.1, \textrm{ and } n = 1\)</span> the orignal statement would hold, for all <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, while the negated statement does not.</p>
<h4 id="part-c-4">Part C</h4>
<h4 id="between-every-two-distinct-real-numbers-there-is-a-rational-number"><em>Between every two distinct real numbers there is a rational number</em></h4>
<p>Between every two distinct real numbers, there is not a rational number.</p>
<p>The original statement is correct. <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> exists as an extension of <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>. As the book describes it, <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> “fills in the gaps” left behind by <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>. While these “gaps” may not be as literal as I am assuming, the expression helps visualize how the two sets coexist, which leads me to my conclusion.</p>
<h3 id="self-evaluation-3">Self-Evaluation</h3>
<h4 id="part-b-7">Part B</h4>
<p>My answer differed in that I switched the direction of the second inequality from <span class="math inline">\(x&lt;1/n\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(x \geq \frac{1}{n}\)</span>. I believe this is correct and that the answer given in the solutions is incorrect. That being said, my answer about which statement is correct (the original or negated statement) would change depending on the direction of this inequality. I stand by my original answer.</p>
