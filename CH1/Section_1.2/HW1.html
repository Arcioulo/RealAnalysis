<h3 id="original-solution">Original Solution</h3>
<h4 id="part-a">Part A</h4>
<h4 id="prove-that-sqrt3-is-irrational"><em>Prove that <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{3}\)</span> is irrational</em></h4>
<p>Assume <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{3}\)</span> is rational. If <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{3}\)</span> is rational, then it can be written as a ratio of two relatively prime natural numbers, a and b, such that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{a}{b} = \sqrt{3}\]</span></p>
<p>Proof:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{a}{b} = \sqrt{3}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{a^2}{b^2} = {3}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{a^2} = {3}{b^2}\]</span></p>
<p>This implies that <span class="math inline">\({a^2}\)</span> and thus a, are divisible by 3. We can rewrite a as a multiple of 3:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[a = 3*c\]</span></p>
<p>where c is some natural number. Subtituting in for a, we see:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{(3*c)}^2  = 3b^2\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[9c^2 = 3b^2\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[3c^2 = b^2\]</span></p>
<p>This is a contradiction as both a and b were assumed to be relatively prime. Thus <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{3}\)</span> is irrational.</p>
<h4 id="does-a-similar-argument-work-to-show-sqrt6-is-irrational"><em>Does a similar argument work to show <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{6}\)</span> is irrational?</em></h4>
<p>Assume <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{6}\)</span> is rational. If <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{6}\)</span> is rational, then it can be written as a ratio of two relatively prime natural numbers, a and b, such that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{a}{b} = \sqrt{6}\]</span></p>
<p>Proof:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{a}{b} = \sqrt{6}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{a^2}{b^2} = {6}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{a^2} = {6}{b^2}\]</span></p>
<p>This implies that <span class="math inline">\({a^2}\)</span> and thus a, are divisible by 6, as well as its factors 2 and 3. We can rewrite a as a multiple of 2:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[a = 2*c\]</span></p>
<p>where c is some natural number. Subtituting in for a, we see:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{(2*c)}^2  = 6b^2\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[4c^2 = 6b^2\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[2c^2 = 3^2\]</span></p>
<p>This is a contradiction as both a and b were assumed to be relatively prime. Thus <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{6}\)</span> is irrational.</p>
<h4 id="part-b">Part B</h4>
<h4 id="where-does-the-proof-of-theorem-1.1.1-break-down-if-we-try-to-use-it-to-prove-sqrt4-is-irrational"><em>Where does the proof of Theorem 1.1.1 break down if we try to use it to prove <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{4}\)</span> is irrational?</em></h4>
<p>Assume <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{4}\)</span> is rational. If <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{4}\)</span> is rational, then it can be written as a ratio of two relatively prime natural numbers, a and b, such that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{a}{b} = \sqrt{4}\]</span></p>
<p>Proof:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{a}{b} = \sqrt{4}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{a^2}{b^2} = {4}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{a^2} = {4}{b^2}\]</span></p>
<p>This implies that <span class="math inline">\({a^2}\)</span> and thus a, are divisible by 2. We can rewrite a as a multiple of 2:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[a = 2*c\]</span></p>
<p>where c is some natural number. Subtituting in for a, we see:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{(2*c)}^2  = 4b^2\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[4c^2 = 4b^2\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[c^2 = b^2\]</span></p>
<p>From theorem 1.1.1 we should able to rewrite <span class="math inline">\(b^2\)</span> at this point in a way that breaks the assumption that b is relatively prime. However, this is not the case and thus we can assume that <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{4}\)</span> is rational.</p>
