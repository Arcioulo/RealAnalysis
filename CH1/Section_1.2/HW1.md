## Problem 1.2.1

### Original Solution

#### Part A

#### _Prove that $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational_

Assume $\sqrt{3}$ is rational.  If $\sqrt{3}$ is rational, then it can be written as a ratio of two relatively prime natural numbers, a and b, such that:

$$\frac{a}{b} = \sqrt{3}$$

Proof:

$$\frac{a}{b} = \sqrt{3}$$

$$\frac{a^2}{b^2} = {3}$$

$${a^2} = {3}{b^2}$$

This implies that ${a^2}$ and thus a, are divisible by 3.  We can rewrite a as a multiple of 3:

$$a = 3*c$$

where c is some natural number.  Subtituting in for a, we see:

$${(3*c)}^2  = 3b^2$$

$$9c^2 = 3b^2$$

$$3c^2 = b^2$$

This is a contradiction as both a and b were assumed to be relatively prime.  Thus $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational.

#### _Does a similar argument work to show $\sqrt{6}$ is irrational?_

Assume $\sqrt{6}$ is rational.  If $\sqrt{6}$ is rational, then it can be written as a ratio of two relatively prime natural numbers, a and b, such that:

$$\frac{a}{b} = \sqrt{6}$$

Proof:

$$\frac{a}{b} = \sqrt{6}$$

$$\frac{a^2}{b^2} = {6}$$

$${a^2} = {6}{b^2}$$

This implies that ${a^2}$ and thus a, are divisible by 6, as well as its factors 2 and 3.  We can rewrite a as a multiple of 2:

$$a = 2*c$$

where c is some natural number.  Subtituting in for a, we see:

$${(2*c)}^2  = 6b^2$$

$$4c^2 = 6b^2$$

$$2c^2 = 3^2$$

This is a contradiction as both a and b were assumed to be relatively prime.  Thus $\sqrt{6}$ is irrational.

#### Part B

#### _Where does the proof of Theorem 1.1.1 break down if we try to use it to prove $\sqrt{4}$ is irrational?_

Assume $\sqrt{4}$ is rational.  If $\sqrt{4}$ is rational, then it can be written as a ratio of two relatively prime natural numbers, a and b, such that:

$$\frac{a}{b} = \sqrt{4}$$

Proof:

$$\frac{a}{b} = \sqrt{4}$$

$$\frac{a^2}{b^2} = {4}$$

$${a^2} = {4}{b^2}$$

This implies that ${a^2}$ and thus a, are divisible by 2.  We can rewrite a as a multiple of 2:

$$a = 2*c$$

where c is some natural number.  Subtituting in for a, we see:

$${(2*c)}^2  = 4b^2$$

$$4c^2 = 4b^2$$

$$c^2 = b^2$$

From theorem 1.1.1 we should able to rewrite $b^2$ at this point in a way that breaks the assumption that b is relatively prime.  However, this is not the case and thus we can assume that $\sqrt{4}$ is rational.
